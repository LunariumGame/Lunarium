# Lunarium

---

In Lunarium, you are a lone astronaut sent on a daring mission to establish the first colony on the moon, as the planet which humanity calls home grows increasingly overcrowded. In this strategy resource management game, you are tasked with mining for ores, cultivating food, and powering your growing colony as more civilians of Planet Earth are shipped offworld. In your quest to tame this barren rock, you can’t be everywhere at once. Luckily, you’ve been equipped with LunaBots, which you can control from the many terminals in your lunar headquarters to manage the colony from a central location. Earth Command has tasked you with building quickly, so to boost resource acquisition, LunaBots have been equipped with advanced building techniques to get the colony up-and-running in about 10 minutes! Carefully manage your power grid, achieve a surplus of food for your growing colony, and triage whatever setbacks the hazardous environment of the moon throws at you! Become the first to achieve a stable, populous colony on the moon by meeting Earth Command’s population threshold!
